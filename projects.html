						<span>Unity, C# - Release June 2020</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Box Voyage</i> is a puzzle-lite adventure game set in a cruise in a box that requires you, 
						an overworked & undercompensated coprorate employee, to complete puzzles to fill your fun meter and have an enjoyable, legally required vacation. In a box. 						
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Box Voyage</i> released on June 1. 
						The game was just an idea in Summer 2019 and began development a few months later.
						I helped craft this game from <b class="bold">prototype, to pitch</b> and helped to foster honest <b class="bold">scheduling</b>, and healthy <b class="bold">team communication</b>. 
						Box Voyage is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286950/Box_Voyage/" target="_blank">now available </a> on Steam! 
						<br>
						<br>
						You can read more about my experience <span class="body-link"><a href="https://walthill.wixsite.com/site/blog/categories/capstone" target="_blank">here</a></span>
						<br>
						<br>
						My goal as <b class="bold">Systems Programmer</b> has been to build and support the base architecture for all of the game's interactions and
						maintain our custom cube-based loading system and traversal while support our code team, and communicating clearly with art & design as a lead.
						I also performed buildmaster tasks and ran meetings for our 4-person code team.

						<i>Reboot</i> tasks the player with taking control of a CRT on roller skates in order to navigate through a
						bowl shaped satellite level in order to beam a transmission back to earth. You must navigate various obstacles around the bowl shaped environment to pick up enough speed to exit the level.
						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Reboot</i> was an invaluable experience as a memeber of an 11 person team and as a lead programmer alongside two other programmers. 
						The game went through a <b class="bold">successful concepting and pitch</b> in order to greenlight the prototype.  The game was also exhibited at the <b class="bold">Champlain Games Festival</b>.
						<br>
						<br>
						My role as a <b class="bold">Gameplay Programmer</b> was to make the <b class="bold">player movement</b> and collisions feel smooth and responsive across all surfaces to help the player get into a flow state. 
						I also performed buildmaster tasks and some animation coding for the project.

						<br>
						<br>
						<i>Exiled</i> is a top down level-based puzzle game created for my Advanced Seminar in Game Programming course while studying in Montreal. All the code is my own with free assets used for art and audio. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I learned a lot from this project over the course of the four months I worked on it from prototyping and <b class="bold">scoping</b>, to <b class="bold">building and refactoring</b> a codebase. 
							Singletons were invaluable for managing sound and game state data across levels. I also built a <b class="bold">random level generator</b> to construct the layouts of my room-based levels. 
							This project also allowed me to utilize some of the <b class="bold">AI programming</b> techniques I learned in my Game AI course during the semester. Enemies wander, patrol, and chase to challenge the player to think quick and think smart. 
						<br>
						<br>
						In all, <i>Exiled</i> was a great learning experience. At the start, I designed the game myself, and by the end, I released the game on Itch.io including a trailer.
